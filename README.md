This is the first cut at a 3D printed case for the Future Proof Homes Satellite1 Dev Kit.  Theres a few things to note:
1. **Print Orientation**: I printed the case standing up. I also used support everywhere. I used a 0.2mm layer height and 20% infill. I used PLA for this print.
2. **Fitment**: The Sattellite1 Dev Kit is a bit tight in the case, but does fit.  There is a notch in the speaker mount to allow clearence for the speaker terminal.  The speaker needs to be fineshed into the case. I used M3*4*4.2 threaded inserts for the speaker mount. I just used 2 #2 x 0.125 inch screws to hold the Satellite1 assembly in place because I designed the case before I recieved the Satellite1 Dev Kit.  
3. **Satellite 1 Case Ring**: The ring holds the speaker grill cloth on the top of the case.  I used 0.15mm layer height. I am planning to create a stencil with the Satellite1 4 button symbols and try to paint the symbols on the grill cloth.  I am not sure how well that will work yet.
4. **Speaker Considerations**: I used the recommended speaker.  The case design was not designed with any acoustic considerations.  The speaker sounds good enough to me, but I do not plan to use it for serious music listening at the present time.
5. **Feet Modification**: The case feet could be modified to add a place to mount felt pads.
